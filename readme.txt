That's a great project idea! Building a Chrome Extension that integrates GPT-3.5 to provide word definitions within context can significantly enhance the user's reading experience by offering deeper insights and understanding. To make this idea a reality, you'll need to take several steps:

1. **Chrome Extension Setup**: Start by setting up the basic structure of a Chrome Extension, which typically includes a `manifest.json` file, background scripts, content scripts, and possibly a popup HTML file if you want to provide a UI for interacting with your extension.

2. **Text Selection Handling**: Implement a feature in your content script that allows users to select a word or a paragraph. You can add an event listener for text selection on the webpage. Once text is selected, you can capture both the selected word and the surrounding paragraph.

3. **API Integration**: You'll need to communicate with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API. This involves sending a request to the API with the selected word, the surrounding paragraph as context, and your prompt structure. You'll need to handle API keys securely, possibly using environment variables or Chrome's storage API to store them securely.

4. **Prompt Design**: Designing the prompt is critical for getting relevant and concise responses from GPT-3.5. Your prompt could instruct GPT-3.5 to provide a definition of the selected word and explain its use within the context of the selected paragraph. For example, "Define [selected word] and explain its meaning in the context of [selected paragraph]."

5. **Displaying Results**: Once you receive the response from GPT-3.5, you'll need to display it to the user. You can choose to do this within a popup, an overlay on the webpage, or any other UI element that suits your design.

6. **Security and Performance Considerations**: Keep in mind the security and performance implications. Ensure that your extension does not excessively slow down the user's browser and that you handle user data responsibly, especially when transmitting information to external APIs.
